          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">1. The Guessing Game on Canvas consists of 10 questions related to trivia or drawings on canvas.
            Your goal is to guess the correct answer for each question!</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">2. There are 3 levels in the game: Level 1 (Easy), Level 2 (Challenging), and Level 3 (Hard).</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Level 1: This level has 3 trivia questions worth 50 points each (150pts total). No hints are available for this level.</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Level 2: This level has 5 questions about drawings on canvas. Each question is worth 100 points (500pts total).
            They have hints to help you guess what is being drawn.</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Level 4: This level has only 2 questions and each of them is worth 175 points (300pts total). Only one question has a hint at
             this level.</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">3. How we calculate points: You have 3 chances to guess the correct answer for each question. The correct answer on:</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- First try: you get 100% of points for that question</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Second try: you get 50% of points for that question</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">- Third try: you get 33% of points for that question</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">4. Hints: be careful, every time you choose to see a hint you will lose 10% of the remaing points for that question.</p>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Example: Question 5 is in Level 2 and it is worth 100pts. If you get the correct answer on your first try you should get 100% of points (100pts).
            But if you choose to see one hint you will lose 10% of 100pts which is equal to 90pts. If you choose to see two hints and you
            guessed the correct answer on your second try (50% of 100pts = 50pts) you will lose 20% of 50pts which is equal to 40pts.</p>
